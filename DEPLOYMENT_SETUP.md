# 🚀 Automatic Deployment Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Configured

Your GitHub Actions workflow now includes automatic deployment that:
1. ✅ Builds your .NET API
2. ✅ Builds your React frontend
3. ✅ Creates a Docker image
4. ✅ Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
5. ✅ Deploys to your chosen platform

## 🎯 Choose Your Deployment Platform

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)

**Step 1: Connect Repository**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select `AIWebApp-with-.NET`

**Step 2: Configure Environment**
Add this environment variable:
```
Gemini__ApiKey = your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Step 3: Deploy**
- Railway will automatically detect the `railway.toml` file
- Click "Deploy"
- Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

**Step 4: (Optional) Add Automatic Deployment to GitHub Actions**
1. Get your Railway token from https://railway.app/account/tokens
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Secrets → Actions
3. Add secret: `RAILWAY_TOKEN` = your token
4. In `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`, uncomment the Railway deployment section

### Option 2: Render

**Step 1: Connect Repository**
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will detect `render.yaml`

**Step 2: Configure**
- Add environment variable: `Gemini__ApiKey`
- Click "Apply"

**Step 3: Get Deploy Hook (for GitHub Actions)**
1. In Render dashboard → Settings → Deploy Hook
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. In GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions
4. Add secret: `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` = the URL
5. Uncomment the Render section in `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`

### Option 3: Azure App Service

**Step 1: Create App Service**
```bash
az webapp create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --plan MyPlan --name aiwebapp-api --runtime "DOTNETCORE:8.0"
```

**Step 2: Get Publish Profile**
```bash
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name aiwebapp-api --xml
```

**Step 3: Add to GitHub Secrets**
1. GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Add secret: `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` = paste the XML
3. Uncomment Azure section in `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`

## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

### Already Configured (No Action Needed)
- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub

### Add These Secrets (Based on Platform)
Go to: https://github.com/RoshanMohamad/AIWebApp-with-.NET/settings/secrets/actions

**For Railway:**
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` - Get from https://railway.app/account/tokens

**For Render:**
- `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` - Get from Render dashboard

**For Azure:**
- `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` - Get from Azure CLI

---

## 📦 Docker Image

Your app is automatically packaged as a Docker image and pushed to:
```
ghcr.io/roshanmohamad/aiwebapp:latest
```

You can pull and run it anywhere:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/roshanmohamad/aiwebapp:latest
docker run -p 5000:5000 -e Gemini__ApiKey=YOUR_KEY ghcr.io/roshanmohamad/aiwebapp:latest
```

## 🚀 Quick Start: Railway (No GitHub Actions Needed)

**Fastest way - Use Railway's native GitHub integration:**

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Select your repo
4. Add environment variable: `Gemini__ApiKey`
5. Deploy
6. Done! ✨

Railway will automatically:
- Detect your Dockerfile
- Build your app
- Deploy on every push to main
- Give you a live URL

**No additional configuration needed!**

## 🔄 How Automatic Deployment Works

When you push to `main` or `backup-before-cleanup`:

1. GitHub Actions triggers
2. Builds your .NET app ✅
3. Builds your React app ✅
4. Creates Docker image ✅
5. Pushes to GitHub Container Registry ✅
6. Deploys to your platform (if configured) ✅

## ✅ Verify Deployment

Check GitHub Actions:
- https://github.com/RoshanMohamad/AIWebApp-with-.NET/actions

Check Docker Image:
- https://github.com/RoshanMohamad/aiwebapp-with-.net/pkgs/container/aiwebapp

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Build Fails:**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify all secrets are set
- Ensure Dockerfile is correct

**Deployment Fails:**
- Verify platform-specific secrets
- Check platform logs
- Ensure environment variables are set

**App Crashes:**
- Check `Gemini__ApiKey` is set
- Verify database connection
- Check platform logs
